Welcome to my website! 
======
I am currently an  assistant professor of economics at <a href="https://www.ccu.edu.tw/">National Chung Cheng University</a> starting from 2019 fall. I received my PhD in Economics from <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/economics/">UT-Austin</a> in 2019. 

My research fields are Empirical Industrial Organization and Applied Econometrics. Current research projects focus on understanding market structures, competition, reputation, and relevant policies. The industries I study include online review platforms, hotels, and automobile.
